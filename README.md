Project Generating Keywords for Google Ads

- Topic : Data Manipulation
- Programming languages : Python
- Packages : Pandas
- Algorithms used : -


## Introduction  : 
Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, and the agency is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. They want to test our skills at creating large campaigns for all of their websites. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. The client says that they want us to generate keywords for the following products:
- sofas
- convertible sofas
- love seats
- recliners
- sofa beds
The brief: The client is generally a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. We will need to focus on such keywords. We will also need to move away from luxury keywords and topics, as we are targeting price-sensitive customers. Because we are going to be tight on budget, it would be good to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match.

## Task :
In this project, we used data manipulation such as make a list of words that users might use to express their desire to buy a cheap sofa., combine each word with each product once before and once after, convert these lists of lists into dataframes, rename the dataframe column and Add campaign column.

## Summary :
In essence, we are telling Google (or Bing, etc.) that we want any of the words in each ad group to trigger one of the ads in the same ad group.
